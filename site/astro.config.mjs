						`One CLI over the machine that agents drive the same way a person does: ${surface} covering windows, input, screen capture, files, processes, packages, network, audio, clipboard, services and messaging, on macOS, Windows and Linux.`,
					details:
						'There are two ways in, and the skill is the primary one: `aos install --skills` writes an agent skill bundled inside the binary to ~/.claude/skills and ~/.agents/skills, after which an agent that already has a shell simply runs the CLI — nothing listening, nothing to start, and it works over SSH into any machine that has the binary. MCP is the second path, for agents that want typed tools: `aos serve mcp` exposes every non-hidden, non-blocking command as a tool, gated by a token minted per run because loopback is not a permission. Both run the identical code path a person gets at a prompt, so what you test by hand is what the agent gets. Safety is structural: commands that need a screen are refused with a reason on a headless box, `file delete` will not touch a filesystem root or $HOME or a system directory, `serve` binds loopback, services are namespaced, and telemetry records argument counts rather than argument values. One verb set means the same thing everywhere (`pkg install` over brew/winget/scoop/choco/apt/pacman/yay/dnf). It extends without forking through JSON adapters and PATH executables, both of which become MCP tools and neither of which can shadow a built-in.',
