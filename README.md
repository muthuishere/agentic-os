# aos

**One CLI over the machine that an agent drives the same way you do — on macOS,
Windows, and Linux.**

Give an agent your machine: windows, input, screenshots, files, shell
commands, packages, network, audio, clipboard. Two ways in, and they run the same code:

- **The agent skill** (primary) — `aos skill install` and an agent that
  already has a shell knows the CLI exists, what its exit codes mean, and which
  commands need a screen. Nothing running, nothing to connect to, and it works
  over `ssh` into any machine that has the binary.
- **MCP** (second) — `aos serve mcp` turns every command into a typed tool for
  agents that prefer that.

One surface, one code path, so what you test by hand is exactly what the agent
gets.

Two things a [2026 survey of desktop-automation tools for agents](https://chatforest.com/guides/best-desktop-automation-mcp-servers/)
found missing across 25+ of them, and what this is built around:

**Safety is structural, not a disclaimer.** Commands that need a screen are
refused with a reason on a headless box instead of failing somewhere deep.
`file delete` will not touch a filesystem root, `$HOME`, or a system directory.
`serve` binds loopback. Services are namespaced so removing one can never reach
a system service. Telemetry records how many arguments a command got, never what
they were.

**One verb set that actually means the same thing everywhere.** `pkg install`
over brew, winget, scoop, choco, apt, pacman, yay and dnf. `--app=Chrome`
matching the same window on all three platforms — which took fixing Windows and
working around Linux to make true.

And it runs where there is no screen at all: most of the surface needs no
display, and on Linux `headless start` provides one when something does.

```console
$ aos system info
$ aos window move Chrome --zone=1B
$ aos capture screenshot --app=Chrome --out=/tmp/shot.png
$ aos pkg install ripgrep          # brew / winget / pacman / apt, same verb
$ aos obs audit --since=24h        # what an agent did on this machine
$ aos skill install             # now an agent runs all of the above
```

## Install

```sh
go install github.com/muthuishere/aos/cmd/aos@latest
aos skill install   # teach Claude Code and other agents to use it
aos doctor
```

Needs Go 1.26+. If you would rather not build, every release also ships
prebuilt binaries for macOS, Linux and Windows:
[the latest release](https://github.com/muthuishere/aos/releases/latest).

```sh
curl -fsSL -o aos https://github.com/muthuishere/aos/releases/latest/download/aos-darwin-arm64
chmod +x aos && ./aos skill install && ./aos doctor
```

One binary, no runtime and no package manager of its own. The macOS window
backend is CoreGraphics through cgo, so a Mac build needs `CGO_ENABLED=1` — the
default when building natively. Linux and Windows are pure Go and cross-compile
from anywhere.

## Agents connect through the skill

```sh
aos skill install
```

That is the whole integration. The skill is compiled into the binary with
`go:embed` and written out to **both** `~/.claude/skills/` and
`~/.agents/skills/`, so the instructions an agent reads can never describe a
different version than the one installed. `skill show` prints it without
installing; `skill uninstall` removes it.

An agent that can run shell commands already has everything it needs to drive
this CLI. What it lacked was knowing the CLI exists, what the exit codes mean
(`0` worked, `1` ran and failed or is a deliberate "no", `2` refused before
doing anything), and which commands need a screen. That is what the skill
supplies — and it buys things a server cannot:

- **Nothing is running.** No port, no process to supervise or restart.
- **It works over SSH**, which is what makes this useful on servers:

  ```sh
  ssh server aos system info
  ssh server aos exec capture -- systemctl is-active nginx
  ssh server 'go install github.com/muthuishere/aos/cmd/aos@latest'
  ```

  A headless server refuses the desktop commands with a reason rather than
  failing deep; on Linux `headless start --wm` gives it a display. Spans are
  written on the machine that ran the command, so `ssh server aos obs audit`
  shows what an agent did *there*.
- **Nothing is filtered out.** Blocking commands (`watch clipboard`,
  `remote share`) are deliberately absent from the MCP tool list, because a
  request/response call has no sensible end. From a shell they are ordinary
  commands.

## And over MCP, if the agent prefers tools

```sh
aos serve mcp
# aos mcp  http://127.0.0.1:14320/mcp
# token    9c23b0efb0a002fe536a579adfd7cdb1
# connect  claude mcp add --transport http aos http://127.0.0.1:14320/mcp \
#            --header "Authorization: Bearer 9c23b0efb0a002fe536a579adfd7cdb1"
```

Loopback is not a permission — every process on the machine shares it, and this
surface drives windows, input and the filesystem. The server mints a token per
run and refuses anything without it, as a bearer header or `?t=`. Set
`AOS_MCP_TOKEN` (or `--token`) to pin one so a client configured once
survives a restart.

Every non-hidden, non-blocking command becomes one tool (`window_move`,
`capture_screenshot`, …) with the same summary, usage and examples the CLI
documents, running the identical `Runner`. Blocking commands are left out on
purpose: a request/response call has no sensible end.

```sh
aos serve tools                              # preview the catalogue
aos serve mcp --groups=window,capture,exec   # expose a subset
```

The protocol layer is [toolnexus](https://github.com/muthuishere/toolnexus)'s
`Toolkit.Serve`, so it is conformance-tested rather than hand-rolled. Full
details, including the token and scoping:
[the docs](https://muthuishere.github.io/aos/mcp/).

## Keeping it running

A server an agent connects to should not depend on a terminal staying open, so
any command — `serve mcp` above all — can be handed to the machine's own service
manager:

```sh
aos service create mcp --autostart --now -- aos serve mcp
aos service status mcp     # exits non-zero unless it is running
aos service list
aos service remove mcp
```

That is a launchd user agent on macOS, a `systemd --user` unit on Linux, and a
Scheduled Task on Windows — per-user throughout, so nothing here asks for admin
or sudo. Every service aos creates is namespaced `aos.<name>`, and
`list` and `remove` only ever see that namespace: this CLI cannot delete a
service it did not create.

## Headless machines

Most of aos needs no screen at all. On a server, in CI, or in a container,
`exec`, `file`, `pkg`, `network`, `system`, `power`, `battery`, `font`,
`debug`, and `serve` work exactly as they do on a laptop.

The desktop commands do need a display, and they say so rather than failing deep
inside a display-server call:

```console
$ aos window list
aos: "window list" needs a display, and this machine has none
Start one with `aos headless start`, or check `aos headless status`.
```

On Linux, give it one:

```sh
aos headless start --size=1920x1080 --wm   # Xvfb + a lightweight WM
aos window list                            # the display is adopted automatically
aos headless stop
```

`headless start` waits for the window manager to claim the screen before
returning, so the next command works instead of losing a race with it. Later runs
of `aos` adopt the managed display on their own — no `export DISPLAY`. An
environment that already names a display always wins, so this never redirects a
real session.

macOS and Windows have no Xvfb equivalent: there, the desktop commands need a
real logged-in session, and `headless status` says so.

### Knowing what will work

Every command declares whether it needs a display, and the whole CLI respects it:

```sh
aos headless status       # is there a display, and where did it come from
aos commands              # screenless machines list only what will run
aos commands --all        # `g` marks a command waiting on a display
aos commands --json       # each entry carries "needs_display"
aos serve mcp --gui=off   # expose only the screenless tools
```

`serve` defaults to `--gui=auto`: GUI tools appear only when this machine
actually has a display. Offering an agent a tool that cannot run is worse than
not offering it — it will try, fail, and try again.

## Command groups

| | |
|---|---|
| **Desktop** | `window` (list · focus · move to zone/split/coords · resize · wait · save a layout · arrange it back), `display`, `mouse`, `key`, `permission` |
| **Machine** | `system` (lock · sleep · restart · shutdown · logout · info), `process` (list · find · kill), `power`, `battery`, `network`, `audio`, `font`, `pkg`, `debug` |
| **Content** | `capture`, `clipboard`, `file`, `exec`, `open`, `launch`, `webapp`, `subtitle` |
| **Remote** | `remote` — hand this screen and its input to a browser on the LAN, for as long as the command runs |
| **Watch** | `watch` — long-running monitors (clipboard, focused window, files and directories) that print one JSON line per change |
| **Agents** | `serve` — expose all of the above over MCP; `service` — keep any of it running as a per-user OS service; `headless` — run the desktop commands with no screen; `completion` — shell completions generated from the registry |

Windows, monitors, input and screenshots are handled by
[windowctl](https://github.com/muthuishere/windowctl); MCP serving by
[toolnexus](https://github.com/muthuishere/toolnexus). Both are libraries this
depends on — aos is the front door.

## Reacting to what happens

`watch` commands run until interrupted and print one compact JSON line per
event, so an agent can pipe one and act on each line.

```sh
aos watch clipboard              # {"event":"clipboard","at":…,"seq":1,"length":34,"digest":"7a37ded45b5e"}
aos watch clipboard --content    # include the text — opt-in, clipboards hold passwords
aos watch window --max=1         # wait for the next focus change, then exit
aos watch file ./src --recursive # {"event":"file",…,"kind":"created","path":"./src/x.go","size":12}
```

The first sample is only a baseline, so `--max=1` means "the next change", which
is also what makes a watcher scriptable. An agent reads these by running the
CLI — which is the case for the skill path in a sentence.

## Window layouts

`window save` captures where everything is; `window arrange` puts it back. The
file is plain JSON, so it is reviewable and editable:

```sh
aos window save ~/.config/aos/layouts/work.json
aos window arrange ~/.config/aos/layouts/work.json
```

## Processes

`exec` starts a program. `process` is for the ones already running:

```sh
aos process list --json
aos process find Chrome
aos process kill 76980
aos process kill Chrome          # by name, only when it is unambiguous
```

Killing by name refuses rather than guesses when the name matches more than one
process, and lists the candidates. It will not kill pid 1, and it will not kill
the `aos` process asking.

## Shell completions

Generated from the registry at runtime, so they cannot describe a command the
binary does not have:

```sh
aos completion zsh  > "${fpath[1]}/_aos"
aos completion bash > ~/.local/share/bash-completion/completions/aos
aos completion fish > ~/.config/fish/completions/aos.fish
```

Completes group names, multi-token routes (`audio output set default`) and the
flags each command documents. Hidden commands are left out.

## How it is put together

| Layer | Where | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| Registry | `internal/cli` | Command tree, longest-prefix route resolution, help, `commands --json`, `Invoke` |
| Plugins | `internal/cli/plugins.go` | Discovers external `aos-<route>` executables |
| Platform helpers | `internal/sys` | Bounded shell-outs, `osascript`, PowerShell |
| Groups | `internal/groups` | One file per group, plus `_darwin.go` / `_windows.go` / `_linux.go` backends |

A group declares its commands once, cross-platform; each backend file supplies
the machine-specific work. A command that genuinely cannot exist somewhere sets
`Platforms` — it still shows in help, marked, and exits 2 with a clear message
rather than pretending not to exist.

### Routes are multi-token

Like omarchy, a route is as many words as it needs: `audio output set default`
resolves by longest prefix, and everything after it is the command's own args.

### Adapters — add a command without writing a program

Most additions are a command line someone already runs. Drop a JSON file in
`~/.config/aos/adapters/` and it becomes a group:

```json
{
  "group": "notes",
  "description": "Personal notes",
  "commands": [
    { "name": "today", "summary": "Open today's note",
      "run": "$EDITOR ~/notes/$(date +%F).md", "platforms": ["darwin", "linux"] }
  ]
}
```

```sh
aos adapters example --write   # a working starter file
aos adapters list              # what this machine has loaded
aos adapters path
```

`run` goes through the platform shell with the user's arguments appended and
quoted. A command can declare `platforms`, `needsDisplay`, and `blocking`, so
yours is gated on exactly the same terms as a built-in — in `commands`, in
`--help`, and in the tool list.

An adapter can never shadow a built-in command: a file in the config directory
must not be able to change what a shipped command does. A malformed adapter is
reported by `commands --check` rather than silently ignored.

### Plugins — when you need a program

Any executable named `aos-<group>-<name>` in `$AOS_BIN_DIR`,
`~/.config/aos/bin`, or on `PATH` joins the CLI. It describes itself with
comment headers in its first 80 lines:

```sh
#!/bin/sh
# aos:summary=Do the thing
# aos:args=<target>
# aos:examples=aos demo do thing a | aos demo do thing b
# aos:platforms=darwin | linux
# aos:route=theme bg-switcher   # when a word contains a hyphen
```

Built-in commands win over a plugin with the same route, so shipping a Go
implementation transparently replaces a script.

## Introspection

```sh
aos commands            # what this machine can run
aos commands --all      # every registered command, including other platforms
aos commands --json     # machine-readable index
aos commands --check    # registry lint; non-zero when something is off
aos debug               # platform, tool availability, plugin dirs
```

## Is it working?

```sh
aos doctor          # functional checks, each with a fix
```

`doctor` does not check whether binaries are on PATH — it round-trips the
clipboard, captures a real screenshot and inspects the bytes, asks the window
backend for a list, and checks the permissions macOS requires. Anything not `ok`
prints what to run to fix it.

## Audit trail

Every invocation — typed at a terminal or called as an MCP tool — records one
OpenTelemetry-shaped span, locally. When you hand an agent your machine, the
question you will eventually want answered is *what did it actually do*:

```sh
aos obs audit --since=24h        # everything, oldest first
aos obs audit --source=mcp       # only what agents asked for
aos obs audit --failed           # only what went wrong
```

```
2026-09-01 01:10:28  mcp   window move                    41ms  ok
2026-09-01 01:10:33  cli   file delete                     2ms  FAILED exit 1
```

And whether it is earning its place:

```sh
aos obs summary                  # calls, routes, cli vs mcp, most used
aos obs stats                    # p50/p95 and failure rate per route
aos obs tail --limit=20          # the last few
aos obs export --since=1h        # OTLP JSON, ready for a collector
aos obs path                     # where it is written
```

Spans record the route, source (`cli` or `mcp`), exit code and duration — and
the *count* of arguments, never their contents, which routinely carry paths and
message bodies. Set `AOS_TELEMETRY=off` to disable, or
`AOS_TELEMETRY_DIR` to relocate.

## Testing on real machines

Unit tests cover the registry and parsing. They cannot tell you whether a
screenshot on Windows is blank or whether a headless server refuses a GUI
command properly, so there is a suite that drives the built binaries on actual
machines — locally, over SSH, and through an agentbus node.

```sh
cp test/e2e/config.example.json test/e2e/config.json   # gitignored; name your machines
task e2e
```

Every step has its own timeout, because the failure that hurts is a hang, not a
wrong answer. On a machine with `hasDisplay: false` the suite asserts the
*refusal* — `window list` must exit 2 saying it needs a display — rather than
skipping quietly.

## Credit, and why this exists

The command shape is [omarchy](https://omarchy.org)'s — DHH's opinionated
Arch + Hyprland desktop. Its CLI is the best system command centre I have used:
`<group> <command>` routes, help that is actually discoverable, a
machine-readable command index, and plugins that are just executables with a
comment header. All of that is theirs, and it is worth studying directly.

I am not on Arch. I work across macOS, Windows and a pile of Linux servers, and
I wanted those ergonomics on all of them. **If I move to omarchy full time I
will use omarchy's CLI — it is better on the machine it was built for, and it
has years of taste in it that this does not.** Until then, this is how I get the
same shape everywhere else, plus the parts an agent needs that a desktop CLI
never had to care about.

This is not a port. Roughly half of omarchy's surface is Arch- and
Hyprland-specific and belongs exactly where it is.

### What omarchy has that this does not

`theme` (32 commands — the whole theming system, and the reason omarchy looks
the way it does), `hyprland`, `plymouth`, `drive` and LUKS, `powerprofiles`,
`hibernation`, `snapshot`, the omarchy `bar` / `plugin` / `shell`, its `menu`
and `tui` launchers, `install` of 33 Arch packages, `mise`, `tailscale`,
`branch`, `channel`, `migrate`. On a Linux box you can drop omarchy's own
scripts in as `aos-*` plugins and they will show up here.

### What this has that omarchy does not

Windows and macOS at all. An agent skill and an MCP server, so an agent can
drive the machine.
JSON adapters. An audit trail and usage stats. `doctor`. A LAN screen share.
Headless operation with a managed virtual display. Cross-platform services.

`docs/porting.md` maps the omarchy 4.0.0.alpha surface group by group.
